#Executive Summary

In this project, I used data from Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises, a barbell lifting study,, to predict different ways barbells are lifted.  The data are measurements from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants .  I applied machine learning algorithm to develop a model that would be able to predict one of the correct way and five of the incorrect ways to lift barbells.  The best prediction model, which has been created by the Gradient Boost learning algorithm, has an accuracy of 97.3% for in-sample data and an accuracy of 96.1% for out-of-sample data.  The model is able to achieve 100% accuracy on test case data

#Tidy Data

The columns with many missing data were removed to produce tidy data. 

```{r}

features <- c("user_name","roll_belt","pitch_belt", "yaw_belt","total_accel_belt","gyros_belt_x","gyros_belt_y","gyros_belt_z","accel_belt_x", "accel_belt_y","accel_belt_z","magnet_belt_x","magnet_belt_y","magnet_belt_z", "roll_arm","pitch_arm","yaw_arm","total_accel_arm","gyros_arm_x","gyros_arm_y","gyros_arm_z","accel_arm_x","accel_arm_y","accel_arm_z","magnet_arm_x","magnet_arm_y","magnet_arm_z","roll_dumbbell","pitch_dumbbell","yaw_dumbbell","total_accel_dumbbell","gyros_dumbbell_x","gyros_dumbbell_y","gyros_dumbbell_z","accel_dumbbell_x","accel_dumbbell_y","accel_dumbbell_z","magnet_dumbbell_x","magnet_dumbbell_y","magnet_dumbbell_z","roll_forearm","pitch_forearm","yaw_forearm","total_accel_forearm","gyros_forearm_x","gyros_forearm_y","gyros_forearm_z","accel_forearm_x","accel_forearm_y","accel_forearm_z","magnet_forearm_x","magnet_forearm_y","magnet_forearm_z")

clean.data<-  data.frame(classe=data[,"classe"], data[,features])
clean.problem<-problem[,features]


nearZeroVar(clean.data)

```
In the tidy data set, there is no variable with near zero variance. 

#Method

I partitioned the data into training and test sets.  The training set was made of 70% of the available data.  The test set was 30%.  I used different machine learning algorithms on existing features first.   If models with existing features could not achieve close to 100% accuracy, I would try to create new features from existing features to improve accuracy. The test set would be used to find the out-of-sample error rate of the best prediction model.

Partition the data
```{r}

set.seed(1234)
inTrain <-createDataPartition(y=clean.data$classe, p=0.7, list=FALSE)
training <- clean.data[inTrain, ]
testing <- clean.data[-inTrain,]

```


Recursive Partition with PCA

```{r}

preProc <-preProcess(training[,3:ncol(training)], method="pca", thresh=0.95)
trainPC <-predict(preProc,training[,3:ncol(training)])
trainPC <- cbind(classe=training$classe,trainPC)
modelFit2 <-train(classe ~. ,method="rpart", data=trainPC)
pred2 <- predict(modelFit2,trainPC)
confusionMatrix(training$classe,pred2)
```


Support Vector Machine with PCA
```{r}

preProc <-preProcess(training[,3:ncol(training)], method="pca",thresh=.95)
preProc$numComp
trainPC <-predict(preProc,training[,3:ncol(training)])
trainPC <- cbind(classe=training$classe,trainPC)
modelFit6 <-svm(classe~., data=trainPC)
confusionMatrix(trainPC$classe,predict(modelFit6,trainPC))
```

Stochastic Gradient Boosting
```{r}

modelFit7 <-train(classe ~., method="gbm", data=training, verbose=FALSE)
pred7 <-predict(modelFit7, training)
confusionMatrix(training$classe,pred7)
```

I estimated the out of sample error using in-sample error. The model with the least in-sample error was Stochastic Gradient Boosting.  It had an in-sample accuracy of 97.3%  (2.7% error rate).  Next, I checked this estimate with cross-validation using test data. The error rate should not have increased significantly if there was no overfitting.

```{r}
pred7 <-predict(modelFit7, testing)
confusionMatrix(testing$classe,pred7)
```

The Gradient Boosting prediction model accuracy on test data was 96.1% (3.9% error rate). The error rate estimate from the cross-validation was almost as low as in-sample estimate.  It was not likely that there was overfitting.


#Test Case Prediction 

The classe predictions on test cases are listed below:
```{r}
predict(modelFit7, problem)
```

The accuracy is 100%.
